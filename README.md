Load and Prepare a Dataset for Binary Classification

→ Load data from a file and split it into input features (X) and output labels (y) with two possible classes (0 or 1).

Train an SVM with Linear and RBF Kernel

→ Fit a Support Vector Machine model using both linear and RBF (non-linear) kernels to separate the data based on decision boundaries.

Visualize Decision Boundary Using 2D Data

→ Plot the decision regions of the trained model to visually understand how it separates the two classes using only two input features.

Tune Hyperparameters like C and Gamma

→ Adjust the model’s regularization (C) and kernel sensitivity (gamma) parameters to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting or underfitting.

Use Cross-Validation to Evaluate Performance

→ Use k-fold cross-validation to test the model on multiple subsets of the data and assess its generalization performance.
